- ✅ `docs/monitoring_services.md` - Now includes:
  - Real-time 1-second monitoring section
  - Updated performance metrics for 1s data
  - Commands reference updated (no _1s_ suffixes)
  - Integration with trades_1s measurement

---

## 🔧 MONITORING SERVICES INTEGRATION STATUS

### Health Monitor Service:
- ✅ **Integrated** - Monitors 1-second data flow
- ✅ **Features Added**:
  - Checks trades_1s measurement health
  - Validates 60 bars/market/minute ingestion rate
  - Alerts if data latency > 2 seconds

### Performance Monitor Service:
- ✅ **Integrated** - Tracks 1-second metrics
- ✅ **Scripts Available**:
  - `scripts/monitor_performance.py` - Python monitoring tool
  - `scripts/monitor_performance.sh` - Shell monitoring tool

## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES (Updated Commands)

### Monitoring Commands (No More _1s_):
```bash
# Python continuous monitoring
python scripts/monitor_performance.py --continuous

# Quick shell check
./scripts/monitor_performance.sh

# Export metrics
python scripts/monitor_performance.py --export metrics.json
```

### Setup Commands:
```bash
# Setup retention policy
./scripts/setup_retention_policy.sh

# Test implementation
./scripts/test_implementation.sh
```

### Backtest Commands:
```bash
# Run backtest (1s data is now default)
python run_backtest.py last_week 10000
```

---

## ⚡ SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

The system is now **UNIFIED** with these settings:

```yaml
# Real-Time Configuration (docker-compose.yml)
SQUEEZEFLOW_RUN_INTERVAL=1      # 1-second execution
SQUEEZEFLOW_DATA_INTERVAL=1     # 1-second data
SQUEEZEFLOW_TIMEFRAME=1m        # Base timeframe
SQUEEZEFLOW_MAX_SYMBOLS=3       # Optimized for speed
SQUEEZEFLOW_LOOKBACK_HOURS=1    # Reduced for performance

# Data Collection
influxTimeframe: 1000            # 1 second (aggr-server/src/config.js)
backupInterval: 1000             # 1 second backup
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

| Item | Status | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| No more `_1s_` in filenames | ✅ | `find . -name "*1s*"` returns only docs |
| Monitoring integrated | ✅ | Services reference trades_1s |
| Documentation updated | ✅ | All docs reflect 1s as default |
| Scripts renamed | ✅ | All scripts use generic names |
| Duplicates removed | ✅ | No redundant files |
| System unified | ✅ | 1-second is the standard |

---

## 🎯 BENEFITS OF CLEANUP

1. **Clarity**: No confusion about which files to use
2. **Consistency**: 1-second data is the standard, not an option
3. **Simplicity**: Single set of monitoring tools
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain
5. **Production Ready**: Clean, professional file structure

---

## 📊 FINAL STATUS

### Before Cleanup:
- 8 files with `_1s_` suffix
- Duplicate documentation files
- Confusion about which tools to use
- Separate "1s" implementation

### After Cleanup:
- **0 files with `_1s_` suffix** ✅
- **Single unified documentation** ✅
- **Clear monitoring tools** ✅
- **1-second is the default** ✅

---

## 🚦 SYSTEM READY

The system is now:
- **UNIFIED** - Single implementation for all data speeds
- **CLEAN** - No duplicate or confusing files
- **OPTIMIZED** - 1-second real-time execution
- **DOCUMENTED** - Clear, updated documentation
- **PRODUCTION READY** - Professional file structure

---

**Cleanup Completed**: 2025-08-08 18:45 UTC  
**Result**: ✅ **SYSTEM FULLY UNIFIED AND CLEANED**

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Monitor real-time performance
python scripts/monitor_performance.py --continuous

# Check system health
./scripts/monitor_performance.sh

# Run backtest with 1s data (default)
python run_backtest.py last_week

# Test implementation
./scripts/test_implementation.sh
```

**The system is now operating with a clean, unified structure where 1-second real-time data is the standard, not an exception.**
