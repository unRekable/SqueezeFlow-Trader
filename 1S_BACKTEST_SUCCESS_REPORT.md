# 1-Second Backtest Success Report

## Date: 2025-08-09
## Status: 🟢 RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY

---

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

### Issue
The backtest engine was finding 0 windows when running same-day backtests.

### Root Cause
When `start_date` and `end_date` were the same (e.g., "2025-08-09"), the engine set:
- `start_time`: 2025-08-09 00:00:00 
- `end_time`: 2025-08-09 00:00:00 (same as start!)

With a 1-hour window, the first evaluation would be at 01:00:00, which is AFTER end_time (00:00:00), causing the loop to exit immediately.

### Fix Applied
Modified `/backtest/engine.py` line 180-183 to set end_time to 23:59:59 for same-day backtests:

```python
# If end_date is the same as or after start_date, set end_time to end of day
# This ensures single-day backtests work correctly
if end_date >= start_date:
    end_time = end_time.replace(hour=23, minute=59, second=59)
```

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS

### Trading Activity
- **00:00 - 08:31**: No trades (no data)
- **08:31 - 09:31**: Warmup period (building 1-hour window)
- **09:31 - 14:31**: Active trading period (5 hours)
- **14:31 - 23:59**: No trades (no data)

### Performance Metrics
- **Evaluations**: 86,399 total (every second)
- **Active Evaluations**: ~18,000 (5 hours of real data)
- **Signal Generation**: Depends on market conditions

## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Why It Works Now
1. Fixed end_time to be end of day (23:59:59)
2. Engine processes all 86,399 seconds in the day
3. Strategy evaluates on empty data (returns no signals)
4. When real data is encountered, strategy can generate signals

### Processing Efficiency
- **1s Steps**: Every second is evaluated
- **Caching**: LRU cache prevents redundant calculations
- **Streaming**: Data loaded in chunks to prevent memory issues

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Wait for Completion**: ~10 more minutes
2. **Review Results**: Check for signals generated
3. **Analyze Performance**: Evaluate strategy behavior with 1s granularity
4. **Noise Analysis**: Determine if filtering is needed
