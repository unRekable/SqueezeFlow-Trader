# Veloce - Clean Rebuild of SqueezeFlow System

## 🎯 Overview

Veloce is a complete architectural rebuild of the SqueezeFlow trading system, built after thorough analysis of the original codebase. It preserves ALL functionality while fixing all architectural vulnerabilities.

## ✅ Key Improvements

### Single Source of Truth
- **VeloceConfig**: ONE configuration system (replaces 5 different config sources)
- **VeloceDataProvider**: ONE data access layer (replaces 4 different patterns)
- **VeloceDashboard**: ONE visualization system (replaces 9 different visualizers)

### Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies, don't create them
- **Protocol Interfaces**: All interactions through defined contracts
- **Testable Design**: Every component works in isolation

### Preserved Functionality
- ✅ 5-Phase strategy execution
- ✅ Multi-timeframe analysis (1s to 4h)
- ✅ CVD divergence detection
- ✅ Open Interest integration
- ✅ All indicators and signals
- ✅ TradingView-style dashboards
- ✅ Docker deployment
- ✅ Real-time 1-second data
