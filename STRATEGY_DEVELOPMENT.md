# SqueezeFlow Strategy - Development & Analysis

## Strategy Overview

SqueezeFlow is a sophisticated 5-phase trading strategy that detects market "squeeze" conditions through Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) divergence analysis between spot and futures markets.

## üéØ Core Trading Logic

### Squeeze Detection Patterns
- **Long Squeeze**: Price ‚Üë + Spot CVD ‚Üë + Futures CVD ‚Üì ‚Üí Buy Signal
- **Short Squeeze**: Price ‚Üì + Spot CVD ‚Üì + Futures CVD ‚Üë ‚Üí Sell Signal

### 5-Phase Analysis Pipeline
1. **Phase 1**: CVD Calculation & Normalization
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-timeframe Divergence Detection (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h)
3. **Phase 3**: Convergence Exhaustion & Reset Detection
4. **Phase 4**: Signal Scoring (minimum 4.0 threshold)
5. **Phase 5**: Risk Management & Position Sizing

## üîç Current Scoring System Analysis

### Issue Identified (August 9, 2025)
**Problem**: Too many trades despite 4.0 minimum score requirement

### Root Cause: Overly Generous Scoring Components

#### 1. CVD Reset Deceleration (3.5 points max)
```python
# Current Issue:
if convergence_strength > 0.1:  # ANY convergence gets points
    score += max_score * 0.2  # 0.7 points too easily
```
**Fix Needed**: Require stronger convergence (>0.3) for base points

#### 2. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation (3.0 points max)
```python
# Current Issue:
points_per_timeframe = max_score / 6  # 0.5 points each
# Getting 2.0+ points with just 4 timeframes aligned
```
**Fix Needed**: Require 5+ timeframes for meaningful score

#### 3. Volume Surge (2.5 points max)
```python
# Current Issue:
if volume_ratio > 1.2:  # Only 20% above average
    surge_score = min((volume_ratio - 1.0) / 2.0, 1.0)
```
**Fix Needed**: Require 2x+ volume for surge detection

#### 4. Volatility Breakout (2.0 points max)
- Too easily achieved with minor volatility increases
- Should require significant volatility expansion

### Recommended Scoring Adjustments
```python
# Stricter thresholds needed:
MIN_CONVERGENCE_STRENGTH = 0.3  # Was 0.1
MIN_TIMEFRAMES_ALIGNED = 5      # Was 3-4
MIN_VOLUME_SURGE = 2.0          # Was 1.2
MIN_VOLATILITY_EXPANSION = 1.5  # Was 1.1
```

## üìä Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Tighten scoring thresholds
- [ ] Add minimum hold time (prevent 1-second trades)
- [ ] Implement trade cooldown period
- [ ] Add drawdown circuit breaker

### Phase 2: ML Integration (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Feature engineering from historical squeezes
- [ ] Dynamic threshold adjustment
- [ ] Pattern recognition for false signals
- [ ] Regime detection (trending vs ranging)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Order flow imbalance detection
- [ ] Cross-exchange arbitrage signals
- [ ] Options flow integration
- [ ] Social sentiment analysis

## üîß Configuration Tuning

### Current Settings (Too Permissive)
```python
# config.py
min_entry_score = 4.0  # Correct but components too generous
min_reset_magnitude = 0.3  # Too low
min_divergence_strength = 0.5  # Too low
```

### Recommended Settings (Production)
```python
# Tighter configuration
min_entry_score = 5.0  # Raise threshold
min_reset_magnitude = 0.5  # Stronger resets only
min_divergence_strength = 0.7  # Clearer divergences
min_hold_time = 300  # 5-minute minimum
trade_cooldown = 60  # 1-minute between trades
```

## üìà Backtest Results Analysis

### Current Performance Issues
- **Trade Frequency**: 100-300 trades/day (too high)
- **Win Rate**: 45-55% (needs improvement)
- **Average Hold**: 1-10 seconds (too short)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.5-1.0 (below target)

### Target Performance Metrics
- **Trade Frequency**: 5-20 trades/day
- **Win Rate**: 60-70%
- **Average Hold**: 5-60 minutes
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.0+

## üéØ Strategy Validation

### What's Working
1. CVD divergence detection is accurate
2. Multi-timeframe analysis provides context
3. Reset detection catches exhaustion points
4. Risk management prevents large losses

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Scoring System**: Too many weak signals pass threshold
2. **Entry Timing**: Entering too early in moves
3. **Exit Logic**: Not riding winners long enough
4. **Filters**: Need stronger trend/regime filters

## üî¨ Research Notes

### CVD Methodology Validation
- Formula: `(buy_volume - sell_volume).cumsum()`
- Verified against aggr.trade reference implementation
- Matches professional platforms (TradingView, Coinalyze)

### Market Microstructure Observations
1. **1-second data reveals**:
   - HFT activity patterns
   - Iceberg order detection
   - Stop-loss clusters
   
2. **Squeeze Patterns**:
   - Most profitable: 15-30 minute duration
   - False signals: Often under 5 minutes
   - Best timeframes: 5m and 15m for confirmation

### Statistical Analysis
- Divergences are mean-reverting 70% of time
- Strongest signals occur at session opens
- Weekend volatility produces more false signals
