# üßπ OLD TIMEFRAMES CLEANUP REPORT - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ALL OLD TIMEFRAMES REMOVED**

---

## WHAT WAS CLEANED

### ‚úÖ InfluxDB Retention Policies Removed:
- ‚ùå `aggr_10s` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_30s` - DELETED  
- ‚ùå `aggr_1m` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_3m` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_5m` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_15m` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_30m` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_1h` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_2h` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_4h` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_6h` - DELETED
- ‚ùå `aggr_1d` - DELETED

### ‚úÖ Remaining Policies (Clean):
- ‚úÖ `rp_1s` - 30 days retention (main)
- ‚úÖ `aggr_1s` - 24 hours retention (recent)
- ‚úÖ `autogen` - Default (unused)

---

## FILES UPDATED

### 1. `aggr-server/src/config.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE: Resampling to multiple timeframes
influxResampleTo: [
    1000 * 30,     // 30s
    1000 * 60,     // 1m
    1000 * 60 * 3, // 3m
    // ... etc
],
influxResampleInterval: 60000,

// AFTER: No resampling (1s only)
influxResampleTo: [],        // DISABLED
influxResampleInterval: 0,   // DISABLED
```

### 2. `init.py`
```python
# BEFORE: Multiple timeframes and continuous queries
"timeframes": ["1m", "5m", "15m"],
# Complex retention policies for 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, 1d

# AFTER: 1-second only
"timeframes": ["1s"],  # Only 1-second data collection
# Simple 1s retention, no continuous queries
```

### 3. `scripts/setup_retention_policy.sh`
- **Enhanced** to automatically clean up old policies
- **Fixed** DROP RETENTION POLICY syntax
- Now properly removes all old timeframe policies

---

## PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Before (Multiple Timeframes):
- **CPU overhead**: Continuous resampling every minute
- **Storage overhead**: 14+ retention policies
- **Query complexity**: Multiple measurements to check
- **Maintenance burden**: Complex continuous queries

### After (1-Second Only):
- **CPU**: No resampling overhead ‚úÖ
- **Storage**: Only 2 retention policies ‚úÖ
- **Queries**: Single measurement (trades_1s) ‚úÖ
- **Maintenance**: Simple and clean ‚úÖ

---

## VERIFICATION

```bash
# Check current retention policies (should only show rp_1s, aggr_1s, autogen)
docker exec aggr-influx influx -database significant_trades -execute "SHOW RETENTION POLICIES"

# Verify no continuous queries remain
docker exec aggr-influx influx -database significant_trades -execute "SHOW CONTINUOUS QUERIES"

# Check measurements (old ones may still exist but won't be updated)
docker exec aggr-influx influx -database significant_trades -execute "SHOW MEASUREMENTS"
```

---

## SYSTEM STATE

### ‚úÖ What's Active:
- **1-second data collection** (`trades_1s`)
- **30-day retention** for historical data
- **24-hour retention** for recent data
- **Application-layer aggregation** (no database overhead)

### ‚ùå What's Removed:
- All resampling configurations
- All continuous queries
- All old retention policies (10s through 1d)
- Complex timeframe management

---

## BENEFITS

1. **Simplicity**: Single data source (1s) for everything
2. **Performance**: No CPU wasted on resampling
3. **Accuracy**: All timeframes derived from same 1s source
4. **Storage**: Cleaner database structure
5. **Maintenance**: Much simpler to manage

---

## COMMANDS TO REMEMBER

```bash
# Setup/cleanup retention policies
./scripts/setup_retention_policy.sh

# Monitor 1s performance
python scripts/monitor_performance.py --continuous

# Check system health
./scripts/monitor_performance.sh
```

---

**Cleanup Completed**: 2025-08-08 19:00 UTC  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **SYSTEM NOW RUNS PURELY ON 1-SECOND DATA**

The system is now:
- **CLEAN** - No old timeframe baggage
- **FAST** - No resampling overhead
- **SIMPLE** - Single data source
- **PRODUCTION READY** - Optimized for real-time
