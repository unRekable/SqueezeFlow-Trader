## 🚨 RECURRING DASHBOARD ISSUES

### The Chart API Version Mismatch (CRITICAL - FIXED 2025-08-12 14:02)
**What Keeps Breaking:** Charts appear empty because `addCandlestickSeries` doesn't exist
**Root Cause:** TradingView Lightweight Charts v4 changed the API
**The Pattern That Breaks EVERY TIME:**
```javascript
// OLD API (v3) - This is what we keep writing but DOESN'T WORK
priceSeries = priceChart.addCandlestickSeries(options);
```

**THE FIX THAT ACTUALLY WORKS:**
```javascript
// NEW API (v4) - Check for API version and use correct method
if (typeof priceChart.addSeries === 'function' && typeof LightweightCharts.CandlestickSeries !== 'undefined') {
    // NEW API (v4+) 
    priceSeries = priceChart.addSeries(LightweightCharts.CandlestickSeries, options);
} else {
    // OLD API (v3) fallback
    priceSeries = priceChart.addCandlestickSeries(options);
}
```

**CRITICAL LESSON:** ALWAYS check API version and provide fallback for both v3 and v4!

### The Multiple Charts Anti-Pattern (CRITICAL - FIXED 2025-08-12 14:18, ENHANCED 2025-08-12 14:32)
**What Happened:** Created 4 separate chart instances trying to make "panes"
**Why It Failed:** 
1. Each chart has its own time axis, impossible to truly sync
2. Data gets truncated to different ranges per chart
3. Indicators don't align with price data

**THE PATTERN THAT ACTUALLY WORKS:**
```javascript
// ONE chart instance with multiple price scales for visual separation
const chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container, options);

// Price on main 'right' scale
priceSeries = chart.addCandlestickSeries({ priceScaleId: 'right' });

// Volume on separate scale with margins (creates visual pane)
volumeSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({
    priceScaleId: 'volume',
    scaleMargins: { top: 0.7, bottom: 0 }  // Pushes to bottom 30%
});

// CVD on 'left' scale with margins
spotCvdSeries = chart.addLineSeries({
    priceScaleId: 'left',
    scaleMargins: { top: 0.4, bottom: 0.3 }  // Middle 30%
});

// Score on overlay scale with margins
scoreSeries = chart.addLineSeries({
    priceScaleId: 'score',
    scaleMargins: { top: 0.8, bottom: 0.05 }  // Bottom 15%
});
```

**CRITICAL LESSON:** Multi-pane appearance = ONE chart + multiple priceScaleId + scaleMargins
**NOT:** Multiple chart instances (breaks data continuity)

**VOLUME BAR BEST PRACTICES (TradingView Standard):**
- Use histogram series with `priceScaleId: 'volume'`
- Set `scaleMargins: { top: 0.8, bottom: 0.02 }` for bottom 20% placement
- Color based on candle direction (green up, red down)
- Hide last value and price line for cleaner appearance
- Format as volume type with appropriate precision

**WRONG - Multiple charts:**
```javascript
const mainChart = LightweightCharts.createChart(mainContainer);
const volumeChart = LightweightCharts.createChart(volumeContainer);
const cvdChart = LightweightCharts.createChart(cvdContainer);
const scoreChart = LightweightCharts.createChart(scoreContainer);
// Complex sync logic trying to make them work together...
```

**RIGHT - Single chart with panes:**
```javascript
const chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container);
// Price on main scale
const priceSeries = chart.addCandlestickSeries({ priceScaleId: 'right' });
// Volume on separate scale with margins
const volumeSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({ 
    priceScaleId: 'volume',
    scaleMargins: { top: 0.7, bottom: 0 }
});
// CVD on left scale
const cvdSeries = chart.addLineSeries({ priceScaleId: 'left' });
// Score on overlay scale
const scoreSeries = chart.addLineSeries({ 
    priceScaleId: 'score',
    scaleMargins: { top: 0.8, bottom: 0.05 }
});
```

**LESSON:** TradingView panes = ONE chart + multiple price scales, NOT multiple charts!

## 🚨 RECURRING DASHBOARD ISSUES

### The Broken Timeframe Logic Pattern
**Frequency:** Very common JavaScript bug
**What Happens:** Code checks `!isNaN(value)` BEFORE checking specific values
**Impact:** Hour and day timeframes completely broken

**THE BUG:**
```javascript
// BROKEN - generic check runs first!
if (!isNaN(tf)) {
    tfKey = tf + 'm';  // '60' becomes '60m' instead of '1h'
} else if (tf === '60') {
    tfKey = '1h';  // NEVER REACHED!
}
```

**THE FIX:**
```javascript
// FIXED - check specific values first!
if (tf === '60') {
    tfKey = '1h';  // Now this works!
} else if (!isNaN(tf)) {
    tfKey = tf + 'm';  // Only for other numbers
}
```

**LESSON:** Always check specific values BEFORE generic conditions in if-else chains!

---

### The Empty Chart JavaScript Error Pattern
**Frequency:** Happens almost EVERY time we modify the dashboard
**What Happens:** Charts appear empty, JavaScript error: "Cannot access X before initialization"
**Root Cause:** Variable references added before the variables are declared

**COMMON MANIFESTATIONS:**
1. `window.charts.volume = volumeChart;` before `volumeChart` is created
2. Trying to store chart references immediately after `window.charts = {}`
3. Code refactoring that moves variable usage before declaration

**DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:**
```bash
# 1. Open browser console to see the exact error
# 2. Look for "Cannot access X before initialization"
# 3. Find where X is first referenced vs where it's declared
# 4. Move the reference AFTER the declaration
```

**FIX PATTERN:**
```javascript
// WRONG - Reference before declaration
window.charts.main = mainChart;
window.charts.volume = volumeChart;  // ERROR: volumeChart doesn't exist yet!

// RIGHT - Reference after declaration
const volumeChart = LightweightCharts.createChart(...);
window.charts.volume = volumeChart;  // OK: volumeChart exists now
```

**PREVENTION:**
- ✅ ALWAYS declare variables before using them
- ✅ Store chart references ONLY after creating the charts
- ✅ Test dashboard in browser after EVERY modification
- ✅ Check browser console for errors immediately

---

### The Indicator Data Truncation Issue
**What Happens:** Price data continues but indicators (CVD, Strategy Score) stop earlier
**Root Cause:** Different data series have different lengths or time ranges
**Impact:** Charts look broken with indicators stopping mid-way

**DIAGNOSTIC:**
- Price chart shows full time range (e.g., 10:00 to 11:00)
- CVD stops at 10:45
- Strategy scores stop at 10:30

**LIKELY CAUSES:**
1. Data sampling/downsampling not synchronized
2. Different data sources with different end times
3. Strategy not generating scores for entire period

## 🔴 CRITICAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

### 1. The Visualizer Multiplication Problem
**What Happened:** 14 different visualizer implementations created, unclear which was active
**Root Cause:** Each debugging session created a "new" visualizer instead of fixing the existing one
**Cost:** Hours debugging why dashboards were empty when the issue was using wrong visualizer

**SOLUTION PATTERN:**
```bash
# BEFORE creating ANY new file, ALWAYS:
grep -r "class.*Visualizer" backtest/reporting/  # Find ALL existing implementations
grep -r "from.*visualizer import" .              # Find what's actually being used
# Only create new if NONE exist or user explicitly requests
```

**PREVENTION RULE:** 
- ✅ ONE implementation per functionality
- ✅ Delete old versions when replacing
- ✅ Document which is active in SYSTEM_TRUTH.md

---

### 2. The Configuration Bypass Trap
**What Happened:** Phase3 and Phase5 didn't import indicator_config, making config changes ineffective
**Root Cause:** Assumed all phases used config without verifying
**Cost:** 3+ hours figuring out why OI disable didn't work

**SOLUTION PATTERN:**
```bash
# When changing ANY configuration:
grep -r "get_indicator_config\|IndicatorConfig" strategies/  # Find ALL users
grep -r "hardcoded_value\|5\.0\|threshold" strategies/      # Find hardcoded values
# Update ALL files or document exceptions
```

**PREVENTION RULE:**
- ✅ ALWAYS verify with grep that ALL components use central config
- ✅ Document any intentional bypasses
- ✅ Test config changes affect ALL components

---

### 3. The Data Path Multiplication
**What Happened:** Strategy used both DataPipeline AND direct InfluxDB queries
**Root Cause:** Different developers/sessions added different data access methods
**Cost:** Data inconsistencies, race conditions, debugging nightmares

**SOLUTION PATTERN:**
```python
# ONE data access pattern per component:
from data.pipeline import DataPipeline  # Use this
# NOT: from influxdb import InfluxDBClient  # Don't mix patterns
```

**PREVENTION RULE:**
- ✅ Define single data access pattern in architecture
- ✅ Enforce through code review
- ✅ Document in ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md

---

### 4. The Temporary File Accumulation
**What Happened:** 11+ debug scripts accumulated in production code
**Root Cause:** Created for debugging, never cleaned up
**Cost:** Confusion about what's production vs debug code

**SOLUTION PATTERN:**
```bash
# Temporary files MUST follow naming convention:
temp_*.py       # Auto-cleanup candidates
debug_*.py      # Debug only
test_*.py       # Test files
# AND add to .gitignore immediately
```

**PREVENTION RULE:**
- ✅ Name temporary files with clear prefixes
- ✅ Add session cleanup hook
- ✅ Never commit debug files

---

### 5. The Documentation Instead of Implementation Anti-Pattern
**What Happened:** Created beautiful documentation about how config should work, but didn't implement it
**Root Cause:** Focused on planning instead of doing
**Cost:** Hours of "it should work" when it was never implemented

**SOLUTION PATTERN:**
```bash
# IMPLEMENTATION FIRST, DOCUMENTATION SECOND:
1. grep -r "pattern" .           # Find what needs changing
2. Edit the actual files         # Make the changes
3. Test it works                 # Verify
4. THEN document                 # Only after it works
```

**PREVENTION RULE:**
- ✅ Implementation before documentation
- ✅ Test before declaring complete
- ✅ Update SYSTEM_TRUTH.md with what ACTUALLY works

---

## 📚 ARCHITECTURAL LESSONS

### Single Source of Truth Violations
**Pattern:** Same logic/config in multiple places
**Examples:**
- OI thresholds in 5 files
- Timeframe definitions scattered
- Data format assumptions

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# ONE place for each truth:
from core.config import CONFIG
# NEVER: local_threshold = 5.0
```

---

### Cascade Dependency Chains
**Pattern:** A → B → C → D (change A, breaks D mysteriously)
**Examples:**
- visualizer → engine → influx → strategy
- config → pipeline → phases → visualizers

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Explicit interfaces, no hidden dependencies:
class Component:
    def __init__(self, explicit_dependency: Interface):
        # Dependencies injected, not discovered
```

---

### Implicit Coupling
**Pattern:** Components assume things about each other
**Examples:**
- Visualizer assumes backtest creates specific files
- Strategy assumes data format

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Explicit contracts:
@dataclass
class BacktestOutput:
    results: DataFrame  # Explicit structure
    trades: List[Trade] # Clear types
```

---

## 🛠️ DEBUGGING PATTERNS THAT WORK

### The Grep-First Pattern
```bash
# ALWAYS start debugging with grep:
grep -r "error_keyword" .
grep -r "class_name" .
grep -r "import.*module" .
# Understand the full picture before changing anything
```

### The Verify-Implementation Pattern
```bash
# Don't assume, verify:
python3 -c "from module import thing; print(thing.actually_works())"
# Test the specific functionality
```

### The Visual Validation Pattern
```bash
# For UI/dashboard issues:
python3 backtest/reporting/visual_validator.py
# Then READ the screenshot to see what user sees
```

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

### DON'T: Create New Implementations When Debugging
- Fix existing code
- Don't create visualizer_v2, visualizer_final, visualizer_really_final

### DON'T: Assume Configuration Cascades
- Verify with grep
- Test all components affected

### DON'T: Mix Data Access Patterns
- Choose one pattern
- Enforce consistently

### DON'T: Leave Debug Code
- Clean up immediately
- Use clear naming conventions

### DON'T: Document Without Implementing
- Code first
- Document what exists, not what should exist

---

## ✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before declaring ANY task complete:

- [ ] Did I grep for ALL occurrences?
- [ ] Did I actually change the code (not just document)?
- [ ] Did I test it works with real execution?
- [ ] Did I update SYSTEM_TRUTH.md?
- [ ] Did I check for cascade effects?
- [ ] Did I remove old implementations?
- [ ] Is there a single source of truth?
- [ ] Are dependencies explicit?

---

## 📝 SESSION PATTERNS

### Starting a Session
1. Read SYSTEM_TRUTH.md
2. Check recent commits
3. Verify what's actually working

### During Development
1. Grep before changing
2. Test after changing
3. Document what works

### Ending a Session
1. Update SYSTEM_TRUTH.md
2. Clean temporary files
3. Commit working code only
