# SqueezeFlow Trader - Project History & Audit Trail

## Overview
This document consolidates all project audits, cleanup reports, and system evolution history for the SqueezeFlow Trader system.

---

## üöÄ Major Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Development
- CVD-based squeeze detection strategy implementation
- Docker-based microservices architecture
- Integration with FreqTrade for execution

### Phase 2: Rolling Window Implementation
- Fixed lookahead bias in backtesting
- Implemented 4-hour rolling windows with 5-minute steps
- Achieved backtest/live trading parity

### Phase 3: 1-Second Real-Time Upgrade (August 2025)
- Upgraded from 60-second to 1-second data collection
- Reduced signal latency from 60+ seconds to 1-2 seconds
- Optimized memory management for high-frequency data

## üìã System Cleanup History

### August 8, 2025 - Unified Real-Time System
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### Files Renamed (Removed _1s_ Suffixes)
- `monitor_1s_performance.py` ‚Üí `monitor_performance.py`
- `monitor_1s_performance.sh` ‚Üí `monitor_performance.sh`
- `setup_1s_retention_policy.sh` ‚Üí `setup_retention_policy.sh`
- `test_1s_implementation.sh` ‚Üí `test_implementation.sh`

#### Services Consolidated
- Removed duplicate monitoring dashboards
- Unified signal monitor into single service
- Integrated 1s performance metrics into main dashboard

#### Database Cleanup
- Removed old 10s/30s/60s timeframe data
- Established single retention policy structure
- Cleaned up 150+ obsolete continuous queries

### Configuration Unification
- All settings moved to docker-compose.yml environment variables
- Removed separate .env and config.yaml files
- Implemented unified_config.py loader

## üìä Documentation Audits

### August 9, 2025 - Documentation Consistency Audit

#### Issues Identified & Fixed
1. **README.md**: Updated backtest description to reflect 1s stepping
2. **system_overview.md**: Corrected rolling window specifications
3. **signal_generation_workflow.md**: Added 1s execution details
4. **unified_configuration.md**: Added missing 1s configuration variables

#### Documentation Structure
- Technical docs remain in `/docs` folder
- Implementation reports consolidated to root
- Claude-specific configs in `/.claude` folder

## üîß Technical Debt Resolution

### Resolved Issues
1. **Memory Management**: Fixed OOM crashes with 1s data through chunking
2. **Data Aggregation**: Repaired broken backup pipeline in aggr-server
3. **Backtest Accuracy**: Corrected window/step timing for same-day tests
4. **Configuration Sprawl**: Unified all settings into single source

### Remaining Considerations
1. **Resource Usage**: 1s mode requires 2-4x more resources
2. **Exchange Limits**: Multiple symbols may hit rate limits
3. **Storage Growth**: 24-hour retention keeps ~500MB/day/symbol

## üìà Performance Evolution

### Original System (Pre-2025)
- 60-second data collection intervals
- 60-70 second signal generation latency
- 4-hour backtest windows with 5-minute steps
- Manual configuration management

### Current System (August 2025)
- 1-second real-time data collection
- 1-2 second total signal latency
- Adaptive backtest windows (1s mode: 1hr/1s, regular: 4hr/5m)
- Automated configuration via docker-compose
- Production-ready with monitoring suite

---

## üéØ Optimization Summary

### Phase 2.2 Optimizations
- **Parallel Processing**: 3x speedup in data loading
- **Vectorized Calculations**: 10-15x faster statistics
- **Streaming Processing**: Prevents memory overflow
- **Chunked Loading**: 2-hour chunks for 1s data

### Performance Gains
| Component | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| Data Collection | 60s | 1s | 60x |
| Signal Generation | 60-70s | 1-2s | 35x |
| Backtest Speed | 30 min/day | 100 windows/sec | 10x |
| Memory Usage | Unbounded | 4-6GB capped | Stable |
