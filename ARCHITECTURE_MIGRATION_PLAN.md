# SqueezeFlow Architecture Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

The SqueezeFlow system currently works but suffers from logical vulnerabilities that cause cascade failures and require hours of debugging. This plan outlines a systematic approach to understand, analyze, and rebuild the system with a clean, truly modular architecture that eliminates these vulnerabilities while preserving all functionality.

**Core Goal:** Transform the working but tangled codebase into a clean architecture that Claude can understand and maintain efficiently, eliminating the "change one thing, break five things" pattern.

## Detailed Phase Descriptions

### UNDERSTANDING PHASES (1-5)

#### Phase 1: Discovery - Count and Map All Files
**Objective:** Establish complete scope of the codebase

**Actions:**
- Count all files by type (.py, .md, .yml, .json, .sh, .js)
- Map directory structure
- Note file sizes (identify unusually large files)
- Check git status for uncommitted changes
- Create initial file inventory

**Output:** Complete file listing with statistics

---

#### Phase 2: Deep Read - Read EVERY File Completely
**Objective:** Understand what each file ACTUALLY does (not assumptions)

**Reading Batches:**
1. Core strategy files (`/strategies/`)
2. Backtest engine (`/backtest/`)
3. Data pipeline (`/data/`)
4. Services (`/services/`)
5. Scripts & utilities (`/scripts/`, `/utils/`)
6. Documentation (`/*.md`, `/docs/`)
7. Configuration files (docker-compose, etc.)
8. Tests and experiments (`/tests*/`, `/experiments/`)

**For Each File:**
- Read complete contents
- Note actual functionality
- Identify patterns and anti-patterns
- Document unexpected findings
- Map hardcoded values

**Output:** Comprehensive understanding of each file's purpose

---

#### Phase 3: Understand - Map How Everything Actually Works
**Objective:** Understand the REAL system flow (not theoretical)

**Analysis Areas:**
- How data flows through the system
- How strategies really execute
- How configs actually cascade (or don't)
- Where the tangled dependencies are
- What the "blockchain-like" interdependencies are
- How services communicate
- What the real initialization sequence is

**Output:** System flow diagram with actual (not intended) behavior

---

#### Phase 4: Dependencies - Trace All Connections
**Objective:** Map every connection between components

**Dependency Types to Map:**
- Python imports (who imports what)
- Function calls (who calls what)
- Database access (who reads/writes what tables)
- Redis channels (who publishes/subscribes)
- File I/O (who creates/reads what files)
- Docker service dependencies
- Configuration dependencies
- Environment variable usage

**Output:** Complete dependency graph

---

#### Phase 5: Dead Code - Identify What's Actually Unused
**Objective:** Find truly dead code (only possible AFTER dependency mapping)

**Dead Code Categories:**
- Files never imported
- Functions never called
- Classes never instantiated
- Scripts never executed
- Old backup files
- Duplicate implementations
- Commented-out blocks
- Experimental code
- Orphaned tests

**Output:** List of safe-to-remove code

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL ANALYSIS PHASES (6-7)

#### Phase 6: VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS - Map All Logical Weak Points
**Objective:** Identify ALL logical vulnerabilities that cause cascade failures

**Vulnerability Types to Identify:**

##### 1. CASCADE VULNERABILITIES 🌊
- **Pattern:** Component A → B → C → D (change A, break D)
- **Example:** visualization → backtest → server → strategy
- **Impact:** Hours debugging why dashboard is empty when issue is data format
- **Document:** Each cascade chain, its length, and failure modes

##### 2. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITIES 🔄
- **Pattern:** A needs B, B needs A
- **Example:** Strategy needs pipeline, pipeline needs strategy config
- **Impact:** Can't initialize, ordering problems
- **Document:** Each circular chain and initialization requirements

##### 3. MULTIPLE TRUTH SOURCES 🎭
- **Pattern:** Same config/logic in multiple places
- **Example:** OI thresholds in 5 different files
- **Impact:** Inconsistent behavior, missed updates
- **Document:** Each duplicated truth and its locations

##### 4. IMPLICIT COUPLING 🕸️
- **Pattern:** Hidden expectations between components
- **Example:** Visualizer assumes backtest creates specific files
- **Impact:** Silent failures, undocumented dependencies
- **Document:** Each implicit expectation

##### 5. DATA FLOW VULNERABILITIES 📊
- **Pattern:** Multiple paths to same data
- **Example:** Strategy reads from InfluxDB AND pipeline
- **Impact:** Data inconsistency, timing issues
- **Document:** Each data access pattern

##### 6. TEMPORAL VULNERABILITIES ⏰
- **Pattern:** Time-dependent initialization/execution
- **Example:** 1-second mode race conditions
- **Impact:** Works in dev, fails in production
- **Document:** Each timing dependency

##### 7. CONFIGURATION CASCADE ⚡
- **Pattern:** Config changes require multi-file updates
- **Example:** indicator_config → pipeline → phases → visualizers
- **Impact:** Miss one file, subtle bugs
- **Document:** Each cascade path

**Output Format:**
```python
vulnerabilities = {
    "cascade_chains": [
        {
            "chain": "viz → backtest → influx → strategy",
            "risk_level": "HIGH",
            "estimated_debug_hours": "3-5",
            "failure_mode": "Silent data loss",
            "files_affected": ["visualizer.py", "engine.py", ...]
        }
    ],
    "circular_dependencies": [...],
    "multiple_truths": [...],
    "implicit_couplings": [...],
    "data_flow_issues": [...],
    "temporal_issues": [...],
    "config_cascades": [...]
}
```

---

#### Phase 7: Vulnerability Validation - Test and Confirm
**Objective:** Verify each vulnerability is real and reproducible

**Validation Tests:**

##### Cascade Test
```python
# 1. Change data format in source
# 2. Run system
# 3. Document what breaks
# 4. Count files needing updates
# 5. Measure time to fix
```

##### Circular Dependency Test
```python
# 1. Try different initialization orders
# 2. Document which fail
# 3. Map the circular chains
# 4. Identify minimum viable order
```

##### Multiple Truth Test
```python
# 1. Change value in one location
# 2. Run full system
# 3. Check all components
# 4. List components using old value
```

##### Coupling Test
```python
# 1. Delete expected intermediate files
# 2. Run each component
# 3. Document failures
# 4. Map hidden dependencies
```

**Output:** Confirmed vulnerability report with reproduction steps

---

### DESIGN PHASES (8-9)

#### Phase 8: Design Solution - Architecture That Eliminates Vulnerabilities
**Objective:** Create clean architecture addressing each vulnerability

**Design Principles:**
- True modularity (components work in isolation)
- Clear boundaries (no spaghetti dependencies)
- Single responsibility (each module does ONE thing)
- Explicit contracts (no hidden expectations)
- Single source of truth (one place for each config/logic)
- Testable components (can test independently)

**Proposed Clean Architecture:**

```

**Vulnerability Solutions:**

##### CASCADE SOLUTION: Decouple with Interfaces
```python
# Define clear interfaces
class DataProvider(Protocol):
    def get_data(self, symbol: str, timeframe: str) -> DataFrame
    
class SignalGenerator(Protocol):
    def generate_signal(self, data: DataFrame) -> Signal

# Components depend on interfaces, not implementations
```

##### CIRCULAR SOLUTION: Dependency Injection
```python
# Dependencies passed in, not created
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, config: Config, data: DataProvider):
        self.config = config  # Injected
        self.data = data      # Injected
```

##### SINGLE TRUTH SOLUTION: Central Configuration
```python
# ONE config file
from core.config import CONFIG

# No other config anywhere
# All components read from CONFIG
```

##### EXPLICIT COUPLING SOLUTION: Contracts
```python
# Clear contracts between components
@dataclass
class BacktestOutput:
    results: DataFrame
    metrics: Dict[str, float]
    trades: List[Trade]
    # Explicit, typed interface
```

## Expected Vulnerabilities to Find

Based on recent issues documented in CLAUDE.md and SYSTEM_TRUTH.md:

1. **Configuration Cascade Hell**
   - Change indicator_config.py requires updating 5+ files
   - Phase3 and Phase5 bypass config system entirely
   
2. **Dashboard Confusion**
   - Multiple competing visualizers
   - Unclear which is active
   - Different data formats expected

3. **Data Access Chaos**
   - Direct InfluxDB queries mixed with DataPipeline
   - Strategy has multiple data paths
   - Inconsistent data formats

4. **OI Integration Mess**
   - Some components use OI, others don't
   - Multiple OI tracker implementations
   - Config not consistently applied

5. **Temporal Confusion**
   - Local vs remote timestamps
   - Timezone handling inconsistent
   - 1-second mode race conditions

6. **Initialization Order Dependency**
   - Hidden requirements on startup sequence
   - Circular initialization loops
   - Service startup race conditions

7. **File Dependency Hell**
   - Visualizers expect specific file outputs
   - No explicit contracts
   - Silent failures when files missing

## Appendix: Key Design Patterns

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```python
# Instead of creating dependencies internally
class BadStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = DataPipeline()  # Creates dependency
        self.config = Config()       # Creates dependency

# Inject dependencies
class GoodStrategy:
    def __init__(self, data: DataProvider, config: Config):
        self.data = data      # Injected
        self.config = config  # Injected
```

### Interface Segregation Pattern
```python
# Define minimal interfaces
class DataProvider(Protocol):
    def get_ohlcv(self, symbol: str) -> DataFrame: ...

class SignalGenerator(Protocol):
    def generate(self, data: DataFrame) -> Signal: ...

# Components depend on interfaces, not implementations
```

### Single Source of Truth Pattern
```python
# ONE place for configuration
from core.config import CONFIG

# Never:
OI_THRESHOLD = 5.0  # Don't hardcode
config = {'oi_threshold': 5.0}  # Don't duplicate

# Always:
threshold = CONFIG.oi_threshold  # Single source
```
