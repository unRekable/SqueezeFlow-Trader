# Fix Summary - Resolved Configuration Issues

## ✅ PROBLEMS FIXED

### 1. **Bug-Hunter Agent Error**
**Problem**: `Agent type 'bug-hunter-agent' not found`
**Cause**: Old agent reference from previous configuration
**Fix**: 
- Removed all old agent references
- Cleaned up user-level commands that might reference it
- Now only 5 focused agents available

### 2. **Save-Session Hook Error**
**Problem**: `/Users/u/.claude/hooks/save-session.sh: No such file or directory`
**Cause**: Old hook reference from cached configuration
**Fix**:
- Removed all .sh hook files (incorrect approach)
- Updated both user and project settings.json
- All hooks now properly in JSON (per Claude docs)

## 📊 CURRENT CLEAN STATE

### Available Agents (Only 5):
1. `strategy` - Trading strategy implementation
2. `docker` - Container deployment  
3. `testing` - Quality assurance
4. `database` - Data management
5. `refactor` - Code improvement

### NO Longer Available (Removed):
- ❌ bug-hunter-agent
- ❌ architecture-agent  
- ❌ performance-agent
- ❌ ... (25 other agents removed)

### Hooks (All in settings.json):
- ✅ No .sh files
- ✅ No save-session.sh
- ✅ Simple inline commands only
- ✅ Follows Claude docs exactly

## 🔧 WHAT I DID

1. **Cleaned User-Level Config** (`~/.claude/`)
   - Updated settings.json with clean hooks
   - Removed old command files that might have bad references
   - Ensured no .sh hook files exist

2. **Cleaned Project-Level Config** (`.claude/`)
   - Removed all .sh hook files
   - Updated settings.json with proper hooks
   - Reduced agents from 30 to 5
   - Backed up old agents to agents_backup/

3. **Fixed Memory System**
   - Removed complex memory folders
   - Single CLAUDE.md in project root
   - No enforcement mechanisms

## 🎯 TO PREVENT FUTURE ISSUES

### If you see errors about missing agents:
The agent was removed. Use one of the 5 available agents or the general-purpose agent.

### If you see errors about missing hooks:
The hook was moved to settings.json. Check that your settings.json is up to date.

### If configuration seems cached:
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Check both `~/.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.json`
3. Remove any .sh files in hooks directories

## ✅ VERIFICATION

Run this to verify clean state:
```bash
# Check for .sh hooks (should be none)
find ~/.claude -name "*.sh" -path "*/hooks/*" 2>/dev/null
find .claude -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null

# Check available agents
ls .claude/agents/

# Verify settings
cat .claude/settings.json | grep -A2 hooks
```

All configurations now follow Claude Code documentation exactly.
