---

## 🎯 **Core Concept: CVD Squeeze Detection**

The system detects "squeeze" conditions by analyzing **Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) divergence** between spot and futures markets across 24+ exchanges.

### **CVD Methodology**
```python
# Industry-standard CVD calculation
volume_delta = buy_volume - sell_volume
cvd = volume_delta.cumsum()  # Cumulative sum over time
cvd_trend = np.polyfit(time_periods, cvd_values, 1)[0]  # Slope analysis
```

### **Squeeze Signal Generation**
- **Long Squeeze**: Price ↑ + Spot CVD ↑ + Futures CVD ↓ → **Negative Score** (Buy Signal)
- **Short Squeeze**: Price ↓ + Spot CVD ↓ + Futures CVD ↑ → **Positive Score** (Sell Signal)

---

## 📊 **Signal Architecture & Data Flow**

### **Multi-Service Pipeline**
```
Exchange APIs → aggr-server → InfluxDB → SqueezeFlow Calculator → Redis → FreqTrade → Order Execution
```

### **Signal Storage**
- **InfluxDB**: Historical squeeze signals, trades, positions
- **Redis**: Real-time signal cache with 5-minute TTL
- **SQLite**: FreqTrade trade database

### **Signal Keys (Redis)**
```
squeeze_signal:BTCUSDT:5     # 5-minute lookback
squeeze_signal:BTCUSDT:20    # 20-minute lookback (PRIMARY)
squeeze_signal:BTCUSDT:60    # 1-hour lookback
squeeze_signal:BTCUSDT:120   # 2-hour lookback
squeeze_signal:BTCUSDT:240   # 4-hour lookback
```

## ⏰ **Timeframe Structure**

### **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**
| Timeframe | Purpose | Usage |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **5min** | Fast reaction | Quick signal detection |
| **10min** | Entry timing | Entry confirmation |
| **20min** | **PRIMARY** | Main signal source |
| **30min** | Entry timing | Entry confirmation |
| **60min** | Trend confirmation | 1-hour trend validation |
| **120min** | Trend confirmation | 2-hour trend validation |
| **240min** | Trend confirmation | 4-hour trend validation |

### **Signal Persistence System**
- **Signal Activation**: When `abs(score) > 0.15`
- **Signal Validity**: 5-10 minutes for timing optimization
- **Signal Refresh**: Strong new signal (50% stronger) overrides old signal
- **Signal Deactivation**: When `abs(score) < 0.1`

## 🔍 **Entry Conditions (ALL Must Be Met)**

### **LONG ENTRY CONDITIONS**
```python
LONG_CONDITIONS = [
    # PRIMARY SIGNAL
    squeeze_score <= -0.5,           # Primary signal threshold
    signal_active == True,           # Signal must be active
    signal_age < 5,                  # Signal max 5 minutes old
    
    # MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMATION
    # Entry timing (one must be true):
    (squeeze_score_10 <= -0.15) OR (squeeze_score_30 <= -0.2),
    
    # Higher timeframe confirmation (one must be true):
    (squeeze_score_60 <= -0.15) OR 
    (squeeze_score_120 <= -0.1) OR 
    (squeeze_score_240 <= -0.05),
    
    # TECHNICAL FILTERS
    rsi < 70,                        # Not overbought
    volume > volume_sma_20 * 1.5,    # 1.5x average volume
    
    # OPEN INTEREST CONFIRMATION
    oi_normalized > 0.8,             # OI above 80% of average
    oi_momentum > -0.1               # OI not declining rapidly
]
```

### **SHORT ENTRY CONDITIONS**
```python
SHORT_CONDITIONS = [
    # PRIMARY SIGNAL
    squeeze_score >= 0.5,            # Primary signal threshold
    signal_active == True,           # Signal must be active
    signal_age < 5,                  # Signal max 5 minutes old
    
    # MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMATION
    # Entry timing (one must be true):
    (squeeze_score_10 >= 0.15) OR (squeeze_score_30 >= 0.2),
    
    # Higher timeframe confirmation (one must be true):
    (squeeze_score_60 >= 0.15) OR 
    (squeeze_score_120 >= 0.1) OR 
    (squeeze_score_240 >= 0.05),
    
    # TECHNICAL FILTERS
    rsi > 30,                        # Not oversold
    volume > volume_sma_20 * 1.5,    # 1.5x average volume
    
    # OPEN INTEREST CONFIRMATION
    oi_normalized > 0.8,             # OI above 80% of average
    oi_momentum > -0.1               # OI not declining rapidly
]
```

## 🚪 **Exit Conditions**

### **LONG EXIT CONDITIONS (Any Can Trigger)**
```python
LONG_EXIT_CONDITIONS = [
    # 1. SIGNAL REVERSAL (Immediate exit possible)
    squeeze_score > 1.0,             # Strong opposite signal (Short Squeeze)
    
    # 2. SIGNAL PERMANENTLY INACTIVE
    (signal_inactive_duration > 30 minutes) AND (abs(squeeze_score) < 0.02),
    
    # 3. EMERGENCY EXIT (Long position with weak signal)
    (position_age > 120 minutes) AND (abs(squeeze_score) < 0.05)
]
```

### **SHORT EXIT CONDITIONS (Any Can Trigger)**
```python
SHORT_EXIT_CONDITIONS = [
    # 1. SIGNAL REVERSAL (Immediate exit possible)
    squeeze_score < -1.0,            # Strong opposite signal (Long Squeeze)
    
    # 2. SIGNAL PERMANENTLY INACTIVE  
    (signal_inactive_duration > 30 minutes) AND (abs(squeeze_score) < 0.02),
    
    # 3. EMERGENCY EXIT (Short position with weak signal)
    (position_age > 120 minutes) AND (abs(squeeze_score) < 0.05)
]
```

### **Emergency Exit Logic**
- **After System Restart**: If position direction unknown, tries both long and short exits
- **Minimum Hold Time**: REMOVED - Immediate exits possible on signal reversal
- **Signal Tracking**: Tracks signal inactive duration to avoid nervous exits

## 💰 **Position Management**

### **Position Sizing**
- **Stake Amount**: 20% of total balance per trade
- **Maximum Positions**: 2 concurrent trades
- **Leverage**: 5x (aggressive, justified by signal precision)

### **Leverage-Based Stop Loss**
```python
# Dynamic stop loss maintains 2.5% spot price movement risk
if leverage >= 5.0:
    base_stoploss = -12.5%           # 5x leverage: 12.5% = 2.5% spot risk
elif leverage >= 3.0:
    base_stoploss = -7.5%            # 3x leverage: 7.5% = 2.5% spot risk  
elif leverage >= 2.0:
    base_stoploss = -5.0%            # 2x leverage: 5% = 2.5% spot risk
else:
    base_stoploss = -2.5%            # 1x leverage: 2.5% = 2.5% spot risk

# Adaptive tightening
if signal_completely_gone:
    final_stoploss = base_stoploss * 0.8  # 20% tighter
```

### **Take Profit**
- **ROI Table**: 4% immediate, 2% after 30min, 1% after 60min
- **Exit Signal Based**: Primary exit via opposite squeeze signals
- **No Fixed TP**: Relies on signal reversal detection

## 🔧 **Critical System Parameters**

### **Strategy Configuration**
```python
# Core thresholds
squeeze_threshold = 0.5              # Entry signal strength
rsi_overbought = 70                  # Long entry filter
rsi_oversold = 30                    # Short entry filter  
volume_threshold = 1.5               # Volume multiplier requirement

# FreqAI ML Integration
use_freqai = True                    # Enable ML enhancement
freqai_confidence_threshold = 0.5    # ML prediction confidence
ml_weight = 0.3                      # ML influence weight (supportive, not blocking)
```

### **Signal Thresholds**
```python
# Signal activation
SIGNAL_ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD = 0.15   # abs(score) > 0.15 activates signal
SIGNAL_DEACTIVATION_THRESHOLD = 0.1  # abs(score) < 0.1 deactivates signal

# Entry requirements  
PRIMARY_ENTRY_THRESHOLD = 0.5        # Main entry threshold
ENTRY_TIMING_THRESHOLDS = {
    '10min': 0.15,                   # 10-minute confirmation
    '30min': 0.2                     # 30-minute confirmation  
}

TREND_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLDS = {
    '60min': 0.15,                   # 1-hour trend
    '120min': 0.1,                   # 2-hour trend
    '240min': 0.05                   # 4-hour trend
}
```

### **Exit Thresholds**
```python
# Signal reversal thresholds
STRONG_REVERSAL_THRESHOLD = 1.0      # Immediate exit threshold
WEAK_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD = 0.02         # Very weak signal
EMERGENCY_WEAK_THRESHOLD = 0.05      # Emergency exit threshold

# Timing thresholds
SIGNAL_FRESHNESS_MINUTES = 5         # Max signal age for entry
INACTIVE_DURATION_MINUTES = 30       # Signal inactive duration for exit
EMERGENCY_POSITION_AGE_MINUTES = 120 # Position age for emergency exit
```

## 🔍 **Signal Scoring Algorithm**

### **Weighted Calculation**
```python
# Core squeeze score formula
squeeze_score = (
    price_factor * 0.3 +             # 30% price momentum
    divergence_factor * 0.4 +        # 40% CVD divergence strength
    trend_factor * 0.3               # 30% CVD trend component
)

# Component calculations
price_factor = price_momentum_normalized
divergence_factor = abs(spot_cvd_trend - futures_cvd_trend) / normalization_factor
trend_factor = (spot_cvd_trend + futures_cvd_trend) / 2 / normalization_factor

# Normalization factor: 100,000 USD per period
```

### **Signal Classification**
```python
def classify_signal(score):
    if score <= -0.4:
        return "STRONG_LONG_SQUEEZE"     # Very strong buy signal
    elif score <= -0.2:
        return "LONG_SQUEEZE"            # Weak buy signal
    elif score >= 0.4:
        return "STRONG_SHORT_SQUEEZE"    # Very strong sell signal
    elif score >= 0.2:
        return "SHORT_SQUEEZE"           # Weak sell signal
    else:
        return "NEUTRAL"                 # No signal
```
