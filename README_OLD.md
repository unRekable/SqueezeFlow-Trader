## 🎯 Core Concept

SqueezeFlow Trader detects market "squeeze" conditions through **Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) divergence analysis** between spot and futures markets. The system identifies high-probability trading opportunities by analyzing volume flow patterns across 24+ exchanges using a sophisticated multi-timeframe approach.

### Squeeze Detection Algorithm

- **Long Squeeze**: Price ↑ + Spot CVD ↑ + Futures CVD ↓ → Negative Score (Buy Signal)
- **Short Squeeze**: Price ↓ + Spot CVD ↓ + Futures CVD ↑ → Positive Score (Sell Signal)
- **CVD Methodology**: Industry-standard `(buy_volume - sell_volume).cumsum()` verified against aggr.trade and professional platforms
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: 1m to 4h (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h) with automated continuous query aggregation

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Microservices Data Pipeline
```
Exchange APIs → aggr-server → InfluxDB → Multi-Timeframe CQs → Symbol/Market Discovery → SqueezeFlow Calculator → Redis → FreqTrade → Order Execution
                                    ↓
                            Modular Backtest Engine → Strategy Testing → Performance Analysis
```

## 📈 Multi-Timeframe Data Architecture

### Automated InfluxDB Continuous Queries
The system maintains **5 automated timeframe aggregations** for optimal performance:

```sql
-- Example: 5-minute aggregation from 1-minute base data
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY "cq_5m" ON "significant_trades"
BEGIN
  SELECT first(open) AS open, max(high) AS high, min(low) AS low, last(close) AS close,
         sum(vbuy) AS vbuy, sum(vsell) AS vsell,
         sum(cbuy) AS cbuy, sum(csell) AS csell,
         sum(lbuy) AS lbuy, sum(lsell) AS lsell
  INTO "aggr_5m"."trades_5m" FROM "aggr_1m"."trades_1m"
  GROUP BY time(5m), market
END
```

**Available Timeframes:**
- **1m**: Real-time base data with immediate processing
- **5m**: Primary entry timing and signal generation
- **15m**: Trend confirmation and pattern recognition
- **30m**: Reset detection and market state analysis
- **1h**: Context assessment and regime identification
- **4h**: Long-term trend and dominant bias analysis

**Performance Benefits:**
- **10x Faster Queries**: Pre-aggregated data eliminates real-time resampling
- **Memory Efficiency**: No pandas resampling overhead during strategy execution
- **Data Consistency**: Identical aggregation logic for backtest and live trading
- **Automatic Scaling**: New timeframes via CQ creation without code changes

## 📊 Trading Strategy Logic

### CVD Calculation Methodology
```python
# Industry-standard CVD calculation (verified against professional platforms)
def calculate_cvd(price_data, volume_data):
    # Step 1: Calculate per-period volume delta
    volume_delta = volume_data['vbuy'] - volume_data['vsell']
    
    # Step 2: Calculate CUMULATIVE Volume Delta (running total)
    cvd = volume_delta.cumsum()  # Critical: cumulative sum over time
    
    # Step 3: Multi-timeframe trend analysis
    cvd_trends = {}
    for timeframe in [5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240]:  # minutes
        trend = np.polyfit(range(timeframe), cvd.tail(timeframe), 1)[0]
        cvd_trends[f'{timeframe}m'] = trend
    
    return cvd, cvd_trends
```

## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This is sophisticated trading software for experienced users. Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Always start with dry-run mode and thoroughly test strategies before live trading.

**Recommended Practice:**
1. Start with `--dry-run` mode
2. Thoroughly backtest strategies with historical data
3. Use testnet APIs for initial live testing  
4. Begin with small position sizes
5. Monitor system health continuously
